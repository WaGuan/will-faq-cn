## How can I view the biometric data of a signature captured using the Signature SDK or sign pro PDF?

This can only be achieved using the full version of Signature Scope which is available solely to qualified document examiners.  
The full (FDE) version can open a signature which was captured using the Wacom Signature SDK or sign pro PDF and display its contents, i.e. the biometric data, in full detail.  

The [Signature Scope Demo Version](/sdk-for-signature/docs/en/signature-scope) will display the biometric data of signatures captured dynamically, i.e. input directly by the current user while running the application.  
This demonstration version cannot be used to import previously captured signatures from a file or the clipboard, nor can it export signatures in any form.  

An alternative analysis tool called [MiniScope](/sdk-for-signature/docs/en/mini-scope) can be used to import existing signatures and display a limited graphical representation of their biometrics.
